# DungeonsOfChaosPrefsConverter
Converts a Dungeons of Chaos PlayerPrefs.txt file between Mac to Android

Dungeons of Chaos is a great game by VOLKER ELZNER.   
As of version 2.2.300 there is a problem if you are transferring saved game files between Android and Mac OSX.
The problem is that acheivements get out of sync between the global PlayerPrefs.txt file and the savegame file.
This is due to the fact that the PlayerPrefs.txt files on the two platforms are incompatible and can't be exchanged.

This python code converts the file between the two formats so that the it can be transferred and this problem can be avoided or corrected.
